# Swagger Server POC

Step 1: Install go-swagger

* `
brew tap go-swagger/go-swagger && 
brew install go-swagger
`

Step 2: Install dependencies using Glide (install using `brew install glide`)

`glide install`

Step 3:

`go build main.go`

Step 4: 

`go run main.go`

# Generating a Server

## Resources used to create Swagger YAML that includes definitions and operations:
* [Swagger Toolbox](https://swagger-toolbox.firebaseapp.com/) - YAML --> JSON

In order to generate a server:

`swagger generate server -f ./swagger/swagger.yml`

This command will spill out the actions it takes as it generates your new REST server. Do not follow the advice at the end of the output. Thereâ€™s an alternate mechanism to do so. Just use glide to update dependencies: `glide up -v`.
